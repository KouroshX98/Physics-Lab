# Physics-Lab
- Physics Lab is my first project and passion, made by unity as an inspiration to make a space to try out mechanic physics as a game. This is the project i loved by heart and spent a lot of time on it to make my dream come out. Although it lacks a lot of features, It still works well and can be used in education system to teach high school students in a visual way

- When the game is first Loaded there are 3 pre-defined system. the first one is the planet system which shows gravity of a big planet and other smaller planets are orbiting it, and one of the planets have a moon too which is orbiting in an elipse ![Physic Lab 1_21_2022 11_46_06 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25118807/150504498-fbfa4451-8cf5-4c97-93f6-04f984cba863.png)
- The second system is an oscilating pendulum cnsisting os=f several small balls connected to the bar above them using a spring component. It demonstrates the osscilations period difference as the Lenght of the pendulum increases.![Physic Lab 1_21_2022 11_46_14 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25118807/150506632-0a561595-50e3-4d77-8e7e-6e5db9be26c2.png)
- The third system is an oscillating spring against the gravity, which shows two spring have the same frequency but with different amplitude. The other spring has different frequency.![Physic Lab 1_21_2022 11_46_25 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25118807/150506170-1b158c67-3c6b-4249-8ed6-b19fa8542971.png)
- The lighting asset was not included due to very large file size, it has to be baked when you first open up the project.
